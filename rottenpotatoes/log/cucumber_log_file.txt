  As a movie buff
  So that I can find movies with my favorite director
  I want to include and search on director information in movies I enter

  Background: movies in database      # features/movies_by_director.feature:7
    Given the following movies exist: # features/step_definitions/movies_steps.rb:2
      | title        | rating | director     | release_date |
      | Star Wars    | PG     | George Lucas | 1977-05-25   |

  Scenario: add director to existing movie                # features/movies_by_director.feature:17
    When I go to the edit page for "Alien"                # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:48
    And I fill in "Director" with "Ridley Scott"          # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:60
    And I press "Update Movie Info"                       # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:52
